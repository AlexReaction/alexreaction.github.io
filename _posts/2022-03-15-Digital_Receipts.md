<h3>Digital Receipts</h3><br>
This post will cover the topic of digital receipts. I will talk about Germany and my 
personal feeling due to living in Germany. You may ask yourself what is a digital receipt.
<!--more-->
The simplist answer to this question I came up with is the following. A digital receipt is a 
representation of a receipt which you would receive at the supermarket. The difference is that the 
receipt will be saved on a digital device (in most cases that will be your smartphone). It can be stored
as a photo or as pdf or as plain text. I personally think the pdf format would be most sufficient here. 
The main reason why every business should offer digital receipts is to cut the huge amount of paper
that is wasted by handing out receipts on paper. Later on I will present a way of how the digital receipt
but be implemented.
<br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
In 2020 Germany passed the so called *Belegausgabepflicht* for electrical registers. Simply
said that means that every business has to hand out a receipt to it's customers. The customer then
has the choice to take or deny the receipt. This law takes on register manipulation and tax evasion 
because the tax office is now able to trace every transaction using the new unique identification number.
<br>
<h2>The current Situation</h2>
Many supermarket chains already implemented the digital receipt in their own app. This is great but
I am not willing to install several apps, one for each supermarket, on my smartphone just to have 
every receipt in the corresponding app. This seems extremly counter intuitive because as a customer I
want to have every receipt stored in one app. Besides the apps of the supermarkets / businesses there 
are multiple apps that try to do exactly that. Some apps simply let you take a photo of the receipt and
then store it in their app. This is a great idea but sadly does not reduce the amount of paper that is
wasted and does not use the fullest potential of the digital receipt idea.
<br>
Some other apps have contracts 
with some businesses. They offer QR code which you can scan at the cashout and then receive the receipt
digitaly in their app. This is great. This should be the way to go because every customer can
decide wether he wants the receipt digitaly or printed on paper. I think many supermarkets don't like
this idea because they want you to download their app because this app is also used to present sales and
coupons which may influence you to shop at their store. That's the reason why they won't hand out the 
storing of the receipt to other apps. 
<br>
Another reason is that every supermarket or even business has a 
slighty differrent register system and some of those system haven't been touched in a long time. That's
why it extremly difficult to implement new changes to a register system. The register system would need
some way to accept a QR code which is presented on the customers phone and then send a email / the receipt
to the email addres or the profile that is associated with the QR code. 


<h2>Conclusion</h2>
There's not much to say other than the digital receipt has great potential. We could cut paper wastage and
make the life easier by storing all receipts digitaly in one app. Every product exchange would not start
with a nerve racking search to find the receipt, you would simply go in your digital receipt app and searchthe name of the item that you want to return. I won't cover the possibility to manage your finances with
this app because this is a whole different topic. I hope you enjoyed reading my little post about digital
receipts. This is my first real post so I am still learning how to write good posts :). I wish you all
the best and have a great day.
